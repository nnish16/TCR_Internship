## Assignment- HR Attrition Data

In this assignment , we need to predict whether a give employee will leave the
organization or not.<br>The target column is Attrition
We will create a model with the following steps:<br>

1.   Import the relevant packages
2.   Download and explore the dataset
3.   Perform EDA, Apply dataset for preprocessing
4.   Predict the target columns


## About Project:

This dataset is regaurding the employees who want to either leave their jobs or continue with to work. The same thing is described in the column named as Attrition in the form of "yes" or "no".
This dataset consists of categorical & numerical data. Attrition is the target column in the dataset while rest other can be features to train the Machine Learning model. We need to analyze the given dataset & build an appropriate Machine Learning model with Higher Accuracy


## Algorithm Used --> Random Forest<br>
## Accuracy Achieved --> 95.23809523809523% ~ 95%<br>
